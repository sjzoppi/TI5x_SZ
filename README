ti5x is an emulator, running on Android, for the venerable
TI-58/58C/59 family of programmable scientific calculators
which were manufactured by Texas Instruments from the late
1970s.

ti5x does aim for 100% authenticity even if not possible
in all cases. Yet, it supports many undocumented features
from the original calculator like the HIR registers and
the /DSZ nn 51/ (decrement no-jump) instructions.

With the current version it is possible to play the famous
Treasure-Island and 3D-Tic-Tac-Toe games.
