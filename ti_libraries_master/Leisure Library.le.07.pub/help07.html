<H1>LE-07 GOLF HANDICAPPER</H1>

<P>
	This program, which is usable with or without the print cradle,
	allows a golfer to calculate his
	handicap according to the handicap system of the USGA.
	Some regional district members of
	the USGA use a slightly different handicapping formula, 
	but the same principles are followed.
</P>

<P>	
	A current handicap is computed by taking 96 percent of the average of 
	a golfer's 10 lowest differentials from his most recent 20 rounds.
	A round's differential is the adjusted score
	(result of an equitable stroke control procedure
	for handicap purposes) less the course rating
	(a difficulty rating assigned by representatives of the authoritative 
	golf organization in the area of the course).  
	A course rating is not necessarily an integer; 70.2 could be a course rating.
</P>
<P>
	Handicaps are calculated to the nearest integer stroke.
	They are normally positive.
</P>
<P>
	Negative results from the handicap 
	calculation can be interpreted as a scratch golfer's
	obligation to his playing partner.  
	(A handicap of -4 means the scratch golfer should
	allocate a stroke to his partner on each of the four 
	hardest handicap holes on the particular course they are playing.)
</P>
<P>
	When at least 5 but fewer than 20 differentials are available, 
	the handicap is calculated using the following table:
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Differentials Available</th>
			<th>Differentials Used in Handicap</th>
		</tr>
		<tr><td>5</td><td>Lowest 1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>6</td><td>Lowest 2</td></tr>
		<tr><td>7</td><td>Lowest 3</td></tr>
		<tr><td>8 or 9</td><td>Lowest 4</td></tr>
		<tr><td>10 or 11</td><td>Lowest 5</td></tr>
		<tr><td>12 or 13</td><td>Lowest 6</td></tr>
		<tr><td>14 or 15</td><td>Lowest 7</td></tr>
		<tr><td>16 or 17</td><td>Lowest 8</td></tr>
		<tr><td>18 or 19</td><td>Lowest 9</td></tr>
	</table>
