<H1>LE-11 â€” Blackjack</H1>

<P>This program simulates the well-known game if Twenty-One. The calculator plays as dealer against
  one player.
</P>

Rules:

<OL>
  <LI>The object of the game is to get closer to a total of 21 with your cards than the dealer's total.

  <LI>Point values of cards: face cards (Jack, Queen, Kind) count as 10; numbered cards count as their
    value; an Ace count as either 1 or 11. Cards are printed and displayed by the calculator as numbers
    1 through 13 for Ace through King, respectively. Therefore, a displayed 1 may count as 1 or 11 points,
    and a displayed 11, 12, 13 counts as 10 points.

  <LI>You and the dealer are each dealt two cards. The dealer's second card is turned face up so you may
    see it. You may choose to stop with the two cards or you may take more cards. Each card is dealt to
    you face up and you may continue to take cards as long as your total remains less than 21.

  <LI>When you finished playing and if you have not broken 21 (and therefore lost) the dealer takes more
    cards, if needed, until his total is greater than 16 or the total number of points accumulated by
    your "show" cards.

  <LI>You win if your total is greater than the dealer's total if you did not break 21. You also win if the
    dealer's total goes over 21. Otherwise you loose.
<UL>
  <LI>Initialize program :
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">&nbsp;SBR&nbsp;</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="yellowbutton">&nbsp;CLR&nbsp;</SPAN>. 0 is displayed.

  <LI>Key in a number (0 to 199017) and press <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">&nbsp;E&nbsp;</SPAN>. The dealer's show card,
    your hole card, and your show card are briefly displayed. You total number of points is then displayed
    and printed.


  <LI>Player Hits (Optional)
    <UL>
      <LI>If you wish to be dealt additional cards, press <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">&nbsp;A&nbsp;</SPAN> for each
        new card. The card is briefly displayed and printed followed by your new total.
      <LI>Each Ace dealt to you is automatically counted as 1 point. If you wish an Ace to be scored
        as 11 points, press <SPAN CLASS="yellowbutton">&nbsp;2nd&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="alttext">&nbsp;A'&nbsp;</SPAN> after you have taken all the cards
        you desire.
    </UL>

  <LI>After taking all the cards you desire, press <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">&nbsp;B&nbsp;</SPAN>. The dealer then
    reveals his hole card and takes other cards as needed. The cards are displayed and printed along
    with the dealer's total, in the same way as for the player.

  <LI>Press <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">&nbsp;D&nbsp;</SPAN> and go Player Hits for a new hand.
