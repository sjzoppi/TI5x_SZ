<H1>LE-18 â€” Football</H1>

<P>Football, a game of two players, must be played with the PC-100A printer. Each player is quarterback for
  his team and has the option of a run, short pass, or long pass on each play. Movement of the ball is
  recorded by printout of the yards to go for a touchdown. The ball must be advanced ten yards or more
  in for plays or less, or possession of the ball changes.
</P>

<P>Scoring is either by touchdown, which may count six or seven points as determined by the calculator,
  or by safeties, which count two points.

<UL>
  <LI>Initialize program :
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">&nbsp;SBR&nbsp;</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="yellowbutton">&nbsp;CLR&nbsp;</SPAN>. 0 is displayed.

  <LI>Decide which player will be on offense first (coin toss).

  <LI>To start a game, press <SPAN CLASS="whitebutton">&nbsp;.&nbsp;</SPAN>, then key in any number and press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">&nbsp;E&nbsp;</SPAN>. The number of yards to go for a touchdown will be printed.

  <LI>The quarterback selects one of the following:

    <UL>
      <LI>Press <SPAN CLASS="whitebutton">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">&nbsp;A&nbsp;</SPAN> for a run play, or
      <LI>Press <SPAN CLASS="whitebutton">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">&nbsp;A&nbsp;</SPAN> for a short pass, or
      <LI>Press <SPAN CLASS="whitebutton">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">&nbsp;A&nbsp;</SPAN> for a long pass.
    </UL>

  <LI>Yards to go for a touchdown is printed after each play:

    <UL>
      <LI>The number is printed twice if a first down has been made
      <LI>If the number is printed once, the display will indicate the yards to go for a first down.
      <LI>Change of possession is indicated by a paper advance followed by printing of the yards to go
        for the new offensive team.
      <LI>Scoring is indicated by a yards-to-go figure, either less than zero (a touchdown) or greater than
        100 (a safety). Touchdowns count as 6 or 7 points and safeties count as 2 points. After a score is
        printed, a new yards-to-go number is printed, and play transfers to the other team.
    </UL>

  <LI>Play continues until the calculator signals the end of a game with a paper advance and the scores
    for teams 1 and 2, respectively. A game consists of 60 to 70 plays. The exact number is set by the
    calculator depending upon the number entered when starting the game.
