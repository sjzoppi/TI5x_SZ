<H1>NG-02 — Time-Speed-Distance with Current Sailing</H1>
<P>This program is actually three routines in one, the first of which operates independently of the remaining two.</P>
<H2>TIME-SPEED-DISTANCE</H2>
<P>Given any two of the three quantities time sailed (At), speed made good (SMG), and distance sailed (Dist), this routine is capable of finding the third value. Varying forms of the basic equation Dist = SMG X At are used in calculations.</P>
<H2>PLANNING WITH CURRENT SAILING</H2>
<P>This routine may be used to plan a trip of multiple legs. Given the expected speed over the bottom (or the desired time of arrival), the distance of the leg, and the departure or starting time of the leg, the calculator will determine the estimated time of arrival (or the speed to make good) and the time of each leg while keeping track of the cumulative distance and time as well. Aside from the time-speed-distance equations above, ETA = ETD + At is the only formula used by this routine. Once the above entries have been made (computation is necessary only when SMG is not entered), the true course to steer (Ct) and the necessary speed through the water (S) may be found by entering the drift (Dr) and set (St) of the current along with the course to make good. Ct and S are derived from the vector equation</P>
<UL>
<LI>V = VMG — Cr </LI></UL>
<P>where:</P>
<UL>
<LI>VMG has magnitude SMG and direction CMG, 
<LI>Cr has magnitude Dr and direction St, and 
<LI>V has magnitude S and direction Ct. </LI></UL>
