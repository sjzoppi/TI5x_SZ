<H1>NG-25 — Noon Sight Fix<BR></H1>
<P>When the navigator obtains an accurately timed sight of the sun as it crosses his local meridian, he can use this program to calculate, not just a line of position, but a longitude, latitude fix.</P>
<P>As the sun approaches your meridian at local apparent noon (LAN), its rate of climb in the sky slows down. During meridian passage, the sun appears to hover in the sky for a minute or two at the same altitude and then slowly begins to descend. To make sure he has observed LAN, the navigator should begin observing the sun several minutes before he expects the meridian passage. By recording his observations every few seconds, the navigator can follow the sun's progress as it gains altitude, reaches the meridian passage, and then starts loosing altitude. The navigator should select a sight which was obtained when the sun reached its highest altitude as his LAN observation.</P>
<P>The noon sight workform will help you organize the data for entry into the calculator program. The sun's equation of time for 12 hours and information with respect to whether the meridian passage of the sun is before or after 12 hours 00 minutes GMT for that day is found at the bottom of the sun/moon pages of the Almanac (table 1).</P>
<P>The navigator should be aware that the GMT of local apparent noon observations, unlike all other sight reduction programs, requires you to enter the whole hours of GMT followed by a decimal point and the minutes/seconds. The declination and d corrections for the noon sight are taken from the Almanac the same as for regular sun sights.</P>
<P>The LAN program should be used after the sextant correction program (single sight mode) NG-18 in order that the observed altitude (Ho) will be stored in calculator memory, If the SEXTANT CORRECTION program was not used, enter Ho manually after step 3 according to the instructions on page 78.</P>
<P>This program calculates the observer's latitude (L) and longitude (X) by using the following formulas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>X = 15 × ( GMT — 12 + EQ ), 
<LI>Dec' = Dec + ( <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">d</SPAN> × MS ). </LI></UL>
<P>taking the signs of L<SUB>DR</SUB> and Dec' into consideration:</P>
<UL>
<LI>L = Dec' - Ho + 90° { if L<SUB>DR </SUB>≥ Dec' } 
<LI>L = Dec' - Ho - 90° { if L<SUB>DR&nbsp;</SUB>&lt; Dec' } </LI></UL>
