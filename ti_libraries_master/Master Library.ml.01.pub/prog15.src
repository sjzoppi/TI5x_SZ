; My (partial) recreation of the "Master Library" module
; that came with the original TI-58C/59 calculators.
;
; This implementation of random numbers does not use
; the low-quality linear-congruential method. Instead, it
; relies on the Op 51 extension in my ti5x emulator to
; return a cryptographically-strong random value. This
; is automatically seeded from system entropy, so there
; is no function provided to manually seed it.
