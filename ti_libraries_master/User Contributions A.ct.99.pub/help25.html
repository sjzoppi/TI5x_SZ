<H1>DR-25 â€” Treasure Island</H1>

<P>You have come to an island looking for treasure. You have a map
  with a 10 x 10 grid locating the treasure and other physical
  features of the island, but you don't know your own starting point
  coordinates. You can move one square at a time in one of the four
  directions (up, down, left, right). Your problem is to use the map
  and the information describing the square you are on after each move
  to determine where you are (which isn't really the point of the game
  but a necessary step) and where the treasure is. The game ends when
  you move to the square that holds the treasure.

<P>There are sharks in the water surrounding the island. If you try to
  go off the island, sharks will attack you. Try it a second time and
  they will eat you, ending the game.

<P>The board will have certain symbols on it which indicate the type of
  terrain you are on. W means woods, M means a mountain, T means a
  trees, C means a cave, R means rocks, and X marks the spot where the
  treasure is.

<P>To start the game:
<UL>
<LI>Enter a seed number: <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">&nbsp;E&nbsp;</SPAN>
<LI>Move Left : <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">&nbsp;A&nbsp;</SPAN>
<LI>Move Right : <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">&nbsp;B&nbsp;</SPAN>
<LI>Move Up : <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">&nbsp;C&nbsp;</SPAN>
<LI>Move Down : <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">&nbsp;D&nbsp;</SPAN>
</UL>

<P>To replay the same map but with a different position press:
  <SPAN CLASS="yellowbutton">2nd</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="alttext">C'</SPAN>
