# This script builds program or library files that can be loaded into the
# calculator app. Invoke it as follows:
#
#    makeprog outfile name=infile [name=infile...]
#
# where outfile is the name of the file to create (the app expects program
# files to end with .ti5p, while libraries end with .ti5l), followed by a
# sequence of items to be included, where name is the component name and infile
# is the file to read the contents from. Valid values for name are as follows
# (in all cases, nn indicates a two-digit number in in [00 .. 99]):
#
#     cardnn
#         infile is the name of a PNG file to be included as the specified card image
#     cardsrcnn
#         infile is the name of an XML template file to be rendered through rendercard
#         and included as the specified card image
#     help
#         infile is the name of an HTML text file to be included as help for
#         the overall library
#     helpnn
#         infile is the name of an HTML text file to be included as help for the
#         specified program number
#     prognn
#         infile is the name of a text file containing a sequence of two-digit
#         numbers indicating compiled program instructions to be loaded into the
#         specified program bank
#     progsrcnn
#         infile is the name of a text file containing program source to be assembled
#         and loaded into the specified program bank
#
# To build a program file, include just a prog00 or progsrc00 component, plus optionally
# a card00 or cardsrc00 component, and a help00 component.
# To build a library file, include one or more components from prog01/progsrc01
# up to prog99/progsrc99, optionally together with corresponding cardnn and helpnn components
# and a help component.
